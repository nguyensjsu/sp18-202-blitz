# While creating the user stories we first focussed on listing the elements of the game which could provide the functionality associated to them. Our game consists of the following elements

1.	Character 1.1 Flappy-Angry Bird Model 1.2 Controlling the motion (movement and rotation) of the Bird. 1.3 Obstacles Model. 1.4 Controlling the motion of the obstacles(Enemy)

2.	Controls 2.1 Input Methods 2.2 Key-Press to provide navigation. 2.3 Begin and End constraints on the game.

3.	Rules 3.1 Score Increment Design 3.2 Difficulty change Desing 3.3 End Game Logic

4.	 Audio 4.1 Add background music

5.	 UI Design 5.1 Menu Design 5.2 Character Design 5.3 Obstacle Design 5.4 End Game Design 5.3 Adjusting screen resolution

## Scenario 1 

- As an actor(Flappy-Angry Bird) I want to maximize the score by avoiding the obstacles that come in my way. 

- As a user/player should be able to select the option between start game and change difficulty as specified in the UI Wireframe.

- As a user/player I should be successfully navigated based on the option selected.

-As a user/player on selecting the start game option I should be able to play the game. 

- As a user/player I should be able to view the score increment  on crossing the obstacle(pipe) by which I can track my progress.

-As a User/player on selecting the change dificulty option I should be navigated to the screen where I am able to choose the difficulty of the game.

- As a user/player of the game I should be able to hear the audio as the game starts.

## Scenario 2 - Technical story for Design Patterns

- As a developer I need to make sure that the player is navigated to the dedicated page as per the option he selects. That is Start game or select difficulty.

- As a developer I need to ensure that the logic implemented for the increase in difficulty should work efficiently.

- As a developer I need to make sure that the speed of obstacles(clouds) work in coordination with the score increment.

- As a developer I need to ensure the logic to toggle between the states correctly for proper implementation of level difficulty.

- As a developer I need to make sure that the proper score update is done when the player collects any bonus items.

- As a developer I need to make sure that the brutal level displays two actors(two birds) on the world.

- As a developer I need to make sure that the speed of the obstacle increases after certain increase in score.
