## Scrum Week 1

# Vishwajeet Kharote

### What tasks did I work on/ complete:

-I started with understanding the different patterns for which patterns can be useful to implement the game project. 
-Also, started learning about how games can be developed in Greenfoot.
-Searched about game development environment.

### What am I planning to work on next
-I am looking forward to implement command pattern or state pattern for the project. 
-Command pattern will be easy to implement as it needs to be added on the selection side before game starts.

### What tasks are blocked 

-I was waiting for other members to come up with their idea and get their suggestions on which game tasks will be easy to implement. 
-Also, I need to discuss about the game like what we can develop which will satisfy possible patterns.
