### What tasks did I work on/ completed?

- I started learning different patterns and searched for different patterns which are generally used in any games.

-I also checked some games on Greenfoot game development environment to check how game can be developed easily and which will be easy for us to start.

## What am I planning to work on next?
-I will try to implement state pattern or command pattern for game options to start stop and changing the object’s value realtime.
- I will try to check different game and try to understand their implemented patterns.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
- I was waiting for others to let me know their ideas about team project and which game we can develop as a team.
