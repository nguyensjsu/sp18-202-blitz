### What tasks did I work on/ completed?

-I started learning Java object patterns for the gaming development.
-I searched for common patterns which are basic for any game development and searched for some basic idea for where to implement those patterns
-Searched for game development environments to get knowledge how easily game can be developed in development environment.

### What am I planning to work on next?

-I am planning to work on state pattern and strategy pattern where state can be maintained for the main object and strategy can be applied to the object.
-I will try to understand and implement observer pattern if we need to pass the information to multiple objects.

###What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
-I wanted to define possible game tasks and check which patterns can be implemented to develop a game to complete those tasks.
-I was waiting for the ideas of other team members which can help me understand the basic of game development.
