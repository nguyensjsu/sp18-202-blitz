## Scrum Week 3
# Murtaza Manaswala

### What tasks did I worked on/ completed?

-I successfully implemented the Template pattern. This pattern is used to handle the difficulty level and speed of the game frames.
-If the bird touches apple, the score increases and the frequency of pipe reduces.
-The same applies on Grape object too but the values of score and frequency changes.

### What am I planning to work on next?
-As I have completed the code I am planning to explain all the team members about my part in the meeting which will help us to integrate the entire game.
-After this I will complete all the remaining work and make the final commit on github with the code of remaining 4 patterns.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

-I was waiting for the Command pattern to be implemented as the screen for selection of difficulty followed the screen which was implemented by using Command Pattern and that difficulty was also doing some actions on the objects i was using like Pipe.
