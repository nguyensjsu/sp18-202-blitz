## Scrum Week 3
# Vishwajeet Kharote

### What tasks did I worked on/ completed?
-I completely implemented the command design pattern and removed all the errors after integrating the entire game source code from other team members.
-The command design pattern acts like a menu which specifies 3 options at the start of the game.
As discussed in the previous scrum meeting I implemented all the modification which were assigned to me.
-After this I made the presentation slides which specified what I have implemented.
-I updated and made all the documentation for the week. 

### What am I planning to work on next?

-As my part is completely done I will commit the source code after checking so that all the team-members have transparency about my work.
-I will do the final review and practice what I am going to present in front of the class.

###What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

-All the team members must complete the respective work so that the integration process is smoothly handled.
-All the members must distribute the slides about what they have implemented and decide the order of presentation.
