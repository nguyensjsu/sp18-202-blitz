## Scrum Week 3

# Abhin Sharma

### What tasks did I worked on/ completed?

-I implemented the strategy pattern in Greenfoot. It is used to change the difficulty in the game.
-I tracked the scrum backlog and made suitable modifications to make the code satisfy all the functionality.
-After this I integrated the code and removed some errors. After testing the code, I updated the documentation and made sure everyone understands my part.  

###What am I planning to work on next?

-After completion of code I will take part in preparing the slides for the presentation and the final documentation stating the work I have done.
-For the last two days we all team members will decide the presentation slides and have a final look at the entire flow of the project.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
-As some of the team members finished a bit late I had to wait for the integration and final review.
-After this we confirmed that the entire scope of the project is completed.
