## Scrum Week 3
# Jaykumar Patel

### What tasks did I worked on/ completed?

-I implemented the observer pattern for the game. 
-On the increase of score the number of obstacles increases. All the obstacles observe the score and once the score reaches a threshold value the obstacles start to increase.
-On completion of the code I explained it to all the team members.  

### What am I planning to work on next?
-After finishing the entire code, I had to complete the remaining documentation and do the final review.
-All the team members in the previous scrum meeting decided to distribute entire presentation and explain the part which they did.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
- As this was the last step in our game development my work was not blocked by any team member.
