## Scrum Week 3
# Harshrajsinh Rathod

### What tasks did I worked on/ completed?

-I successfully implemented the State design pattern. This pattern is used to toggle the difficulty level.
-The state of current difficulty level is active while the other states are disabled.
-This was very interesting to implement and needed clear understanding of the pattern.

### What am I planning to work on next?
-As I have completed the code I am planning to explain all the team members about my part in the meeting which will help us to integrate the entire game.
-After this I will complete all the remaining work and make the final commit on github.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

-I was waiting for the Command pattern to be implemented as the screen for selection of difficulty followed the screen which was implemented by using Command Pattern.
