## Scrum Week 2

# Abhin - Strategy


* What tasks did I work on / complete?
- As per the functionality of the game I had decided to implement Strategy pattern and was working on that only and applied almost of that pattern. Along with that I also helped other team members to fix their errors.

* What am I planning to work on next?
- I will complete my remaining code with working functionality and try to merge it with the existing code of applied patterns by other team members. I will also apply other pattern if the project's basic requirements has been met.

* What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
- While doing my code, other team members were also facing the difficulties and that's why I was doing my code along with them so that was tough task for me but some how I managed to do it.
