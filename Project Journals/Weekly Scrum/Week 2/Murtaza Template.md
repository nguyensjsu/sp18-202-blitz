## Scrum Week 2

# Murtaza - Template Design Pattern


* What tasks did I work on / complete?
- When I found that this game is interesting and I can apply Template pattern to it, I was doing that pattern and I found it too much interesting too. After getting the full depth knowledge, I applied that to implement the pattern and finally completed it in just one day.

* What am I planning to work on next?
- Next week with the same code I will add some extra functionalities to check whether it's working or not. If it is working then I will merge with the master code else I am gonna revert the changes I made after this because the code before this is working fine.

* What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
- As of now, I was doing my part and it also got over so smoothly so there was no case of waiting for other person but reviewing code of the other mates and suggest them edits took some time.
