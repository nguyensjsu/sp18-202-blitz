## Scrum Week 2

# Harshrajsinh - State


* What tasks did I work on / complete?
- After getting knowledge of all the design patterns basics I took the State Design pattern to work on and impement it in our game to check whether the pattern is working or not.

* What am I planning to work on next?
- Finally I will review all the code for indentation and the final working of the State pattern and going to commit it with our team github repo for the feedback.

* What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
- After finishing my part I am bit confused that whether my code will fit with the other 4 patterns or I will have to make changes or the code will conflict, so I will have to wait till the other 4 patterns are ready.
