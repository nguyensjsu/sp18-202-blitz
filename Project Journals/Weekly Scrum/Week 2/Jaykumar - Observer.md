## Scrum Week 2

# Jaykumar - Observer


* What tasks did I work on / complete?
- I read all the details about the observer pattern that I was assigned to do and got the in detail knowledge of that pattern and along with that applied simple coe and got feedback from other mates. When they gave me green signal I implemented the whole design.

* What am I planning to work on next?
- Next week I will apply some more modules to game functionalities like extra hurdles and score updation logic change to make the game better and interesting.

* What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
- When my first phase to implement basic code of Observer was finished, I submitted to our group to give a feedback on that code and team members took around 2 days to review it because they were also busy with their patterns so at that time I was blocked.
