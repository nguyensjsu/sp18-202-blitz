### XP Core Value - Simplycity

Simplicity is that principle of XP which makes all the things simple in the project progress and not predicting tomorrowâ€™s needs. It means to take small, simple steps towards the goal and mitigating issues on the fly.

- In our first team meeting, we have discussed multiple game engines and have prioritized on the most efficient platform. As a result, we have decided to develop a user-friendly application using simple methods and implementations.

- Together we will judge our code subjectively using TUBE (Testable, Understandable, Browser, Understandable) qualities.
