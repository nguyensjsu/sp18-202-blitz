### XP Core Value - Feedback

- In the last week, every member took responsibility of researching on game framework. From the feedback it seemed that, in order to understand the features everyone should develop small game app on the game engine respectively and came up with one very basic app  each and we gave feedback on each personâ€™s game.

- We decided to meet Tuesday again after each of us understand that particular game on their respective machine, and later in meeting we will decide which patterns to implement in it.

- I have taken feedback about the game ideas and with the decision on game engine on Tuesday, we will also finalize our game with final patterns and game engine and code with better idea.
