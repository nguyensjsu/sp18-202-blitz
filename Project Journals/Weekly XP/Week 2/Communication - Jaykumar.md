### XP Core Value - Communication

As per my opine Building an efficient software system requires communicating system requirements to the developers of the system. One of the great ways to achieve this is regular meet-ups and effective documentation.

- Meetups: 
All of us were assigned a game engine named Greenfoot to study and come prepared next week. We have extended this exercise further. Now, each one of us will prepare a sample game and present it in the next meeting.
This will help everyone of us to point out and compare the pros and cons of different game engines. Like I and going to make Flappy World with simple functionalities and will ensure that everyone in the team collaborates upon deciding which specific game engine to follow. 

- Documentation:
This is another effective way of communication because it gives us a better understanding that what and how we are going to do in game development. We will achieve this by posting our respective files and codes on GitHub, so that one could refer as and when needed.
