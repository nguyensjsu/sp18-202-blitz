### XP Core Value – Feedback

-	In the stand-up meeting, everyone shared their feedback related to different tasks like game levels and design patterns and all the hard, good and funny moments etc.

-	We have provided feedback and improvements on developmental work of each other, so that we can deliver the best possible projects in upcoming semesters too.

-	We listened to everybody's opinions and changes were implemented immediately and at the end time committed all the code to Github.
