### XP Core Value - Eliminate Waste
* Overproduction, unneccesary transportation, over-processing, defects, inventory, motion, waiting are the major types of waste in development of any game.
* These types of waste can be explained with more relevance when a software is developed in any particular language viz. volatile requirements, irrelevant code and functionality, delay in software development process, quality issues and defects.
Activities related to project this week:
* All the irrelevant obstacles that were planned intially were removed. Some of the functionalities that were initially developed where removed on implementing the design patterns.
* We are working in such a way that dependency of a component don't lead to waiting scenario for other team members. For example, we designed sprites first then used them in canvas and then used canvases to design level of game, thus we don't need to be dependent on each other by developing similar components concurrently that don't have dependency on each other
