## XP Core Value - See the whole

The xp value "see the whole" allowed me to focus on project as a whole rather than just focussing on a assigned sprint task.
* In the last week, we developed the entire game with all the obsatcles  and design patterns.
* I took care that whatever process that is followed, everyone knows about the project as a whole.
* We also removed all the errors and checked all the corner cases of the entire project.
* Along with the development, we have also kept out scrum burndown chart updated.
* During the entire week we regularly keet on meeting to discuss and solve design and implementation problems.
* I made sure that every team members know the whole flow of the project. 
* In this week, as a part of the See the whole value I pushed for a consensus on how the obstacles  fit in the game.
* After successful implementation of 5 design patterns, we integrated the entire game.
* As a part of whole project objectives I enforced regular task board and sprint task sheet updates.
