## Team Member - Abhin Sharma

### XP Core Value - Build Integrity In

*The xp value "Build Integrity In" allowed me to ensure that the source code builds successfully at the end of the day. 
*All the commits pushed on git were error free and if some error occured then I contacted the responsible person to solve the issue.. 

### Free from 'flaw'
* The flaws in the game development were avoided by keep the progress and the final product aligned.
* Every change made in working directory is reviewed by the team before adding the change to source. This ensured all the source code is tested by each member before making final commit.

### Free from 'defect'
* TDD approach decreases the amount of time to progress from introduction of defect to actually fix it.
* Team notes down all test cases possible before actually implementing the functionality by having a quick consensus.


#### As this week was the last week we all had consensus for every change, update or add in the source in order to build integrity.
