### XP Core Value - Feedback

Feedback is must when you are working in an industry or a team project and it is also sometimes essential for the members of the team for whom the error is big but other finds it too easy.

- In my team the members are too active in the manner of feedback as whenever i submit my code they were available there to check and give reply that is it good to go or not plus the necessary changes.

- The other thing in the terms of my team's feedback which I want to appreciate is they were always giving a genuine feedback like if they do not like something then they were saying that on that time only so that I can make change and take care of that mistake in the next code iterations.

Currently, I took feedback from what will I do and the response about how difficult it will be for me and plan accordingly.
