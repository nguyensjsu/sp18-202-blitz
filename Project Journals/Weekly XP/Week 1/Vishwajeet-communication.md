## Team Member – Vishwajeet Kharote
### XP Core Value - Communication
I will be practicing the XP core value of communication and make sure it is followed during the entire project. Communication will help all the team members to effectively place their ideas and make sure the entire team has proper coordination. This will allow us to track the progress as we develop the game and avoid unwanted trouble in later phase. 
The following activities will be undertaken for maintaining proper communication:
The development of entire game will be broken down into smaller modules (backlogs) and all the team members will be assigned each module for respective sprint.
Every week a meeting will be held to keep each team member updated about the work done by other members. This will help to resolve any conflicts/backlogs at regular intervals.
All the important events in the meetings will be documented.
This week we discussed about all the game ideas we need to implement, the game engine to be used and the estimated duration.
