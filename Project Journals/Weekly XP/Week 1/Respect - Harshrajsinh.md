### XP Core Value - Respect

- Respect refers to provide attention to each input like we mean everyone’s view, idea and discussion among team members and to the product owner with exploring it's feasibility for proposed issue.

-  Respect lets each team member feel appreciated, thus it leads to high enthusiasm and allegiance towards team and the objective of the project plus he will also think that whatever I am doing is not going waste and it is also taken in consideration too.

- Respect is dependent on other XP core values : Communication, Courage, Feedback and Simplicity together leads to have respect among each other because in every one of the other values you will have to make a better involution with team.
